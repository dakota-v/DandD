  Players start n Newtown, answering a call to arms for adventurers posted across
the land. Upon arriving to the town they are gathered into the local inn by the
local guards and told to stay in there rooms until they are summoned in the morning.
After the night passes the PCs are whisked away to the central square of the town
and told about a great peril rising in the eastern forest. The threat is a gathering
of Kobolds that are following some unknown force, preparing for an unknown
purpose. You are asked to find out the true nature of what is going on, find the
source of the gathering, and eliminate it if at all possible.

  When the PCs decide to travel to the eastern forest they enter to find obvious
signs of creatures harvesting the forest. They walk through a forest path back to
a clearing in which there is several Kobolds and some war siege machinery. After
the encounter the players can either pursue the kobolds that retreat or try to
chase the evil Quasit that appears during the final fight, or to return back to
the city to tell the mayor of Old Guard.

  If the PCs choose to kill the rest of the kobolds they travel through the Kobolds
tunnels killing off the rest of the enemy allowing the Quasit to escape.

  If PCs follow the Quasit they chase him through the forest facing small groups
of mobs until a final battle in which the PCs find 2 Relics and some loot from the
random tables, but they allow the kobolds to continue destroying the forest and to
start their plan to destroy Old Guard, forcing the PCs to rush to the city to
stop the attack.

  Once they return to Old Guard they are greeted and they are asked to describe
their findings. The PCs tell the kind about the choice they made and receive
commendations based upon their choice.
