# Section One: Kobold Invasion
# DM Notes:
This adventure is designed to introduce mystery and speculation up until the end when they finally fight the demon. Even then there is nothing to say that it may not be currently shape shifted into another form. The story needs to flow, and a lot of the names are pretty interchangable.
### Chapter One
Our adventures find them selves in the town of New Town.
